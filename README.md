Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## User stories

```
As a user,
So that I can share my photos,
I want to post pictures

As a user,
So that I can be identified as me,
I would like to have an account

As a user,
So that I can create an account,
I would like to sign up

As a user,
So that I can tell other users what I think of their photos,
I would like to comment

As a user,
So that I can tell other users what I think of their photos,
I would like to like a picture
